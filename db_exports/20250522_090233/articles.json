The IPA symbol for it is \u27e8\u0280\u031d\u030a\u27e9, but since this sound is actually a simultaneous [\u03c7] and [\u0280\u0325], it can also be transcribed as \u27e8\u03c7\u0361\u0280\u0325\u27e9.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the languages that are claimed to have a <strong>voiceless uvular fricative</strong> might actually have a <strong>voiceless uvular fricative trill</strong>, since a complication of uvular fricatives is that the shape of the vocal tract may be such that the uvula vibrates.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Contribute</h2>\n\n<p>Ready to contribute?
