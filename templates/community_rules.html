    </div>
    
    <div id="dispute-resolution" class="rules-section">
        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>When disagreements arise, follow these steps to resolve them constructively:</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Direct Discussion</h3>
        <p>Start by discussing the issue on the article's discussion page. Focus on content rather than personalities, and try to understand all perspectives.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Seek Third Opinion</h3>
        <p>If direct discussion doesn't resolve the issue, request input from uninvolved editors through the <a href="/community/help">Help Forum</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Community Mediation</h3>
        <p>For persistent disputes, request formal mediation through the <a href="/community/mediation">Mediation Request</a> page. A designated mediator will help facilitate discussion.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Administrative Review</h3>
        <p>As a last resort, administrators may be asked to review and make a determination based on community guidelines and previous consensus.</p>
        
        <h3>During Disputes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain civility throughout the process</li>
            <li>Avoid editing the disputed content until resolution</li>
            <li>Focus on finding consensus, not "winning" the dispute</li>
            <li>Take breaks if discussions become too heated</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div id="enforcement" class="rules-section">
        <h2>Rule Enforcement</h2>
        <p>To maintain a healthy community, these rules are enforced through a progressive system:</p>
        
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>First-time or minor violations typically result in a warning explaining the issue and how to correct it.</p>
        
        <h3>Temporary Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Repeated violations or more serious infractions may result in temporary editing restrictions, such as requiring approval for edits or limits on specific actions.</p>
        
        <h3>Temporary Blocks</h3>
        <p>Continued violations despite warnings or restrictions may result in temporary blocks from editing, typically increasing in duration for repeat offenses.</p>
        
        <h3>Indefinite Blocks</h3>
        <p>Severe violations or patterns of disruptive behavior that continue despite interventions may result in indefinite blocks.</p>
        
        <h3>Appeals</h3>
        <p>Users who believe enforcement actions were unfair may appeal through the <a href="/community/appeals">Appeals Process</a>. Appeals are reviewed by uninvolved administrators.</p>
        
        <p>Enforcement actions are taken with the goal of maintaining community standards while helping users become productive contributors.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rules-footer">
        <p>These community rules are subject to change as Kryptopedia evolves. Significant changes will be announced on the <a href="/community">Community Portal</a>.</p>
        <p>Last updated: April 2025</p>
