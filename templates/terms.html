</div>

<div class="terms-intro">
    <p>Welcome to Kryptopedia. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Kryptopedia's website, services, and content. By accessing or using Kryptopedia, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <p>While traditional terms of service often rely on lengthy legalese, we've tried to make ours as clear and straightforward as possible, in keeping with our commitment to transparency.</p>
</div>

<div class="terms-section">
    <h2>1. The Basics</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 What is Kryptopedia?</h3>
    <p>Kryptopedia is a decentralized knowledge base focused on cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and related topics. Our platform combines wiki-style collaborative content creation with blockchain-based incentives for contributors.</p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Who Can Use Kryptopedia?</h3>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to create an account. If you're under 18, you may only use Kryptopedia with parental or guardian consent. The service is not available to users previously removed from the platform or to anyone restricted from receiving digital token rewards.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3 Account Registration</h3>
    <p>While basic reading access doesn't require an account, you'll need to register to contribute content, participate in discussions, or receive rewards. You agree to provide accurate information during registration and to keep your password secure. You're responsible for all activity under your account.</p>

This license continues even if you stop using our service.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You own the content or have the right to share it</li>
        <li>The content doesn't infringe on anyone else's rights</li>

    <h2>3. Rewards System</h2>

    <h3>3.2 No Guaranteed Value</h3>
    <p>Tokens earned on the platform may have no monetary value. Their value may fluctuate, and there's no guarantee they can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. Rewards are provided solely as an incentive mechanism within our ecosystem.</p>
    
    <h3>3.3 Tax Implications</h3>
    <p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your receipt or use of rewards. We do not withhold taxes or provide tax advice.</p>
