    <h1>Our Values</h1>
</div>

<div class="values-intro">
    <p>At Kryptopedia, our values aren't just words on a page—they're the fundamental principles that guide how we build our platform, manage our community, and evaluate our success. These values reflect the same revolutionary spirit that gave birth to Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency movement.</p>

<div class="values-section">
    <h2>Decentralization</h2>
    <div class="value-content">
        <div class="value-icon">
            <i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="value-description">
            <p>We believe that distributed systems are more resilient, fair, and resistant to corruption than centralized ones. Just as Bitcoin eliminated the need for central banks, Kryptopedia aims to reduce reliance on centralized knowledge authorities.</p>
            
            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Distributing content storage across multiple nodes</li>
                <li>Avoiding single points of failure or control</li>
                <li>Making decisions through community consensus rather than top-down authority</li>
                <li>Ensuring no single individual or entity can dictate platform policies</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="value-description">
            <p>We uphold the sovereign right of individuals to control their digital, financial, and intellectual lives. Personal freedom is not just a political ideal but a design principle for our systems.</p>
            
            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respecting privacy and minimizing unnecessary data collection</li>
                <li>Supporting pseudonymous participation without compromising reputation systems</li>

        <div class="value-description">
            <p>We believe free markets are the most efficient and fair way to allocate resources and determine value. Our token system creates a marketplace of ideas where valuable contributions are naturally rewarded.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Creating incentive structures that reward quality over quantity</li>
                <li>Allowing market mechanisms to highlight the most valuable content</li>
                <li>Enabling voluntary exchanges of value between platform participants</li>
                <li>Avoiding artificial manipulation of content visibility or reward distribution</li>

    <h2>How We Apply Our Values</h2>
    <p>Our values aren't abstract concepts—they directly shape our platform:</p>
    
    <div class="value-applications">
        <div class="application-item">
            <h3>Platform Design</h3>
            <p>From our reputation system to our editing workflow, every feature is designed to reflect and reinforce our core values. We regularly audit our systems to ensure they align with these principles.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-item">
            <h3>Governance Decisions</h3>
            <p>When faced with difficult choices about content policies or feature development, we use our values as a decision-making framework, asking: "Which option best upholds our commitment to decentralization, liberty, and market principles?"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-item">
            <h3>Content Standards</h3>
            <p>While we embrace free expression, we have baseline standards rooted in intellectual honesty and factual accuracy. Content that deliberately misleads or defrauds users violates our core values and is not welcome.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="application-item">
            <h3>Community Management</h3>
            <p>Our moderation approach emphasizes voluntary association and self-governance, with minimal intervention necessary only to maintain the integrity of the platform's purpose.</p>
